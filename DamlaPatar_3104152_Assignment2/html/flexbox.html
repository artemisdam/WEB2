			<h2>What is Flex Box?</h2>
			<br>
			<!--The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return).  -->
			Flexbox is a layout model introduced in CSS3, which helps to create flexible and responsive layouts.<br>
			It is designed to provide a simpler and more efficient way to distribute space and align items within a container, regardless of the size and dimensions of the container or its contents.<br>
			In this report, we will discuss the various features of flexbox and how they can be used to create responsive layouts.
			<br>
			<!--The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return).  -->
			<h4>Features of Flex Box</h4>
			<!--The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination. -->

			<h3>Flex container:</h3>
			A flex container is the parent element that holds the flex items. By setting the display property of an element to "flex", it becomes a flex container. All direct children of a flex container become flex items.
			<br>
			<!--The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return).  -->
			<h4>Flex items:</h4>
			Flex items are the child elements within a flex container that can be arranged using flexbox. By default, flex items are arranged in a single row, but they can also be arranged in columns or in both directions. Flex items can also be aligned
			and distributed within the container using various flexbox properties.
			<br>
			<!--The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return).  -->
			<h4> Flex direction:</h4>
			The flex-direction property is used to specify the direction of the flex container. It can be set to row (horizontal), column (vertical), row-reverse (horizontal, reversed), or column-reverse (vertical, reversed).
			<br>
			<!--The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return).  -->
			<h4>Flex wrap:</h4>
			The flex-wrap property is used to specify whether the flex items should wrap to the next line if there is not enough space in the container. It can be set to nowrap (default), wrap, or wrap-reverse.
			<br>
			<!--The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return).  -->
			<h4>Flex flow:</h4>
			The flex-flow property is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties. It is used to set both properties at once.
			<br>
			<!--The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return).  -->
			<h4>Justify content:</h4>
			The justify-content property is used to align the flex items along the main axis (the direction specified by the flex-direction property). It can be set to flex-start (default), flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, or space-evenly.
			<br>
			<!--The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return).  -->
			<h4>Align items:</h4>
			The align-items property is used to align the flex items along the cross-axis (the perpendicular axis to the main axis). It can be set to flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, or stretch (default).
			<br>
			<!--The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return).  -->
			<h4>Align content:</h4>
			The align-content property is used to align the rows or columns of flex items when there is extra space in the container. It can be set to flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, or stretch (default).

			-It allows for easy vertical centering of elements.<br>
			-Flexbox makes it easier to align and distribute elements within a container, without using floats or positioning.<br>

			<!--The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. If the href attribute is not present, the <a> tag will not be a hyperlink. -->

			<h4>Conclusion</h4>
			Flexbox is a powerful layout tool that makes it easier to create responsive and dynamic layouts. <br>
			By using its various properties, developers can create complex designs without resorting to complicated code or external libraries. <br>
			Its advantages make it a popular choice among front-end developers for creating modern, responsive web designs.
