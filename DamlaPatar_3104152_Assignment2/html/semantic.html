			<h2>What is Semantic HTML and How It Improves Your Site</h2>
			<p>
				HTML is the language of the web, it determines what content appears on a web page and in what order.
				<br><br>
				<!--The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). -->
			<h3>What is semantic HTML?</h3>
			<!--The H3 element defines a level-three heading. This heading is more important than an H4 but less important than an H2. -->
			<br>
			<!--The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). -->
			Semantic HTML code that uses HTML tags to effectively describe the purpose of page elements.
			Semantic HTML code communicates the meaning of its elements to both computers and humans, which helps web
			browsers, search engines, assistive technologies, and human developers understand the components of a web page.
			Some other common semantic HTML tags are:
			<br>
			<!--The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). -->
			<!--The HTML <h4> tag represents a level 4 heading in an HTML document. -->
			<h4>SEMANTIC HTML TAGS</h4>
			<!--The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. If the href attribute is not present, the <a> tag will not be a hyperlink. -->
			<a href="https://hartenfeller.dev/blog/underused-semantic-html-tags">
				<!--The <IMG> tag is used to incorporate in-line graphics (typically icons or small graphics) into an HTML document.  -->
				<img class="img_html2 " src="../images/tags.JPG">
			</a>

			<br>
			<!--The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). -->
			Header: introductory content as page header or article header <br>
			Nav: section that provides navigation links as a menu, table of content or breadcrumbs <br>
			Main: main content of a page <br>
			Article: complete or self-contained composition of a website that can independently distributable or reusable <br>
			Section: generic section of a page, usually comes with a heading <br>
			Aside: content that is indirectly related to the main content like a sidebar <br>
			Footer: footer to the nearest sectioning content for example a page footer or author details after a blogpost
			<br><br>
			<!--The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). -->
			<!--The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. If the href attribute is not present, the <a> tag will not be a hyperlink. -->

			<h3>What are the benefits of semantic HTML?</h3>
			<br>
			<!--The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). -->
			Semantic HTML not only makes your code easier to read, it also makes it more accessible to assistive technology and search engines.
			<h4>Accessibility</h4>
			<!--The HTML <h4> tag represents a level 4 heading in an HTML document. -->
			Screen readers rely on semantically rich HTML to process web pages and help users with low vision navigate them.
			Semantic tags tell screen reader users where they are and how they can interact with the current page.
			<br>
			<!--The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). -->
			<h4>SEO</h4>
			<!--The HTML <h4> tag represents a level 4 heading in an HTML document. -->
			<br>
			<!--The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). -->
			Like with assistive technologies, semantic markup helps search engine crawlers navigate your page to better understand its structure and contents.
			Semantic HTML is a great way to show search engines what to index and get the most from your crawl budget.
			<br>
			<!--The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). -->
			<h4>Human Readability</h4>
			<!--The HTML <h4> tag represents a level 4 heading in an HTML document. -->
			Web developers write and read hundreds of lines of code daily, so anything that makes their jobs easier is worth the effort.
			Semantically rich markup allows developers to locate specific page elements more quickly than sifting through a pile of <div> tags.
				<br>
				<!--The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). -->
				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<!--The HTML <h4> tag represents a level 4 heading in an HTML document. -->
				Employing semantic HTML is a crucial principle in web development as it aids in establishing a well-defined structure and significance to the content of a webpage. Semantic HTML can enhance accessibility, SEO, and maintainability of a website
				by making use of relevant tags and attributes, thereby ensuring that developers create websites that are both accessible and optimized for search engines. Adhering to these best practices can lead to the creation of web pages that are easily
				maintainable and have better search engine rankings.
